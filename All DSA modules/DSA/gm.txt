for the sliding window sir
Hitesh Motwani12:55 AM
If we are dealing with
top/maximum/minimum/closest
'K' elements among 'N' elements, we
will be using a Heap.

If the given input is a sorted array
or a list, we will either be using
Binray Search or the Two Pointers
strategy.
If we need to try all combinations
(or permutations) of the input, we
can either use Backtracking or
Breadth First Search.

sir send it in chat sir

Most of the questions related to
Trees or Graphs can be solved
either through Breadth First
Search or Depth First Search.

For a problem involving arrays, if
there exists a solution in O(n^2)
time and O(1) space, there must
exist two other solutions: 1) Using a
HashMap or a Set for O(n) time
and O(n) space, 2) Using sorting
for O(n log n) time and O(1) space.

If the problem is related to a
LinkedList and we can't use extra
space, then use the Fast & Slow
Pointer approach.
